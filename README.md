# Real-Time-Health-Monitoring-System-with-Alert-Notifications
Developed a wearable monitoring system using the 8051 microcontroller to measure heart rate and temperature with real-time data display on an LCD, and utilized UART-based serial communication to transmit data and integrate a Bluetooth module (HC-05) for alert notifications to connected devices when vital signs exceed or fall below thresholds. Utilized IÂ²C communication to interface the DS1307 RTC module, ensuring accurate timestamped alert messages, enhancing personal healthcare by providing timely alerts and real-time data for improved monitoring and analysis.
